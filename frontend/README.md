## Quickstart

If you're using NPM the following simple scripts are avalable to you to help
your development. This is before you start using the dev server directly.

```bash
# install helper scripts
npm install

# start the dev server on first available port.. likely 8080
npm start

# run the linter to check your js 
npm run lint
```
